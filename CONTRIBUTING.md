Contribution Rules📚:
You are allowed to make pull requests that break the rules. We just merge it ;)
Do NOT add any build steps e.g npm install (we want to keep this a simple static site)
Do NOT remove other content.
Styling/code can be pretty, ugly or stupid, big or small as long as it works
Add your name to the contributorsList file
Try to keep pull requests small to minimize merge conflicts
